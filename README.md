Quantum Protector is a machine learning project developed for the final project in the Tuwaiq Academy Boot Camp for Quantum Computing.

## Overview

Quantum Protector combines quantum computing and machine learning to enhance cybersecurity measures. It uses the Qiskit library for quantum computing and scikit-learn for classical machine learning, specifically Quantum Support Vector Classification (QSVC). The project aims to provide advanced classification capabilities with the integration of quantum kernels.

## Features

- Quantum Support Vector Classification (QSVC)
- Flask web application for user interaction
- Integration with quantum kernels for enhanced classification
