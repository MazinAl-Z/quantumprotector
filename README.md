Quantum Protector is a machine learning project developed for the final project in the Tuwaiq Academy Boot Camp for Quantum Computing.

## Overview 🔭

Quantum Protector combines quantum computing and machine learning to enhance cybersecurity measures. It uses the Qiskit library for quantum computing and scikit-learn for classical machine learning, specifically Quantum Support Vector Classification (QSVC). The project aims to provide advanced classification capabilities with the integration of quantum kernels.

## Features 🧰

- Quantum Support Vector Classification (QSVC)
- Flask web application for user interaction
- Integration with quantum kernels for enhanced classification

## Running it Locally

To run Quantum Protector locally, follow these instructions:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuantumProtector.git
cd QuantumProtector
```

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Pip
- Other project dependencies (see Installation Section)

## Running on Linux 🐧
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed on your Linux distribution.

### Running on Arch-based Distros

🚧 **Note:** As an Arch Linux user, I faced challenges getting Pip installed for weeks. If you encounter issues, consider trying a Debian-based distro.

### Running on Debian-based Distros

🛠️ A script to install dependencies is included. Execute the following commands:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

🚀 Now you're ready to run Quantum Protector locally!

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Feel free to use or modify it as needed!

## Running on Windows

To install on Windows, please follow these instructions:
